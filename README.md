## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- JavaScript

### What I learned

This challenge has taught me the importance of a proper markup and the power of CSS, alongside media queries, also, in the cause of the challenge, learning to work with an API again, feels awesome (by API, I meant importing the google fonts from google api and using it in the challenge).

The challenge has also added to my knowledge, in terms of using markdown files and in committing a file to github, basically working with the command line has improved some more, all thanks to frontend mentor's challenge. Furthermore, working on toggling the navigation menu button.

### Continued development

In future projects or challenges, I'ld love to add a javascript function that changes the modes' of the page, say a light mode and a dark mode.
